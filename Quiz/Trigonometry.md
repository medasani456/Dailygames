Answers
    Sine (sin) = opposite/hypotenuse, Cosine (cos) = adjacent/hypotenuse, Tangent (tan) = opposite/adjacent, Cosecant (csc) = hypotenuse/opposite, Secant (sec) = hypotenuse/adjacent, Cotangent (cot) = adjacent/opposite.
	The Pythagorean identity is sin^2(θ) + cos^2(θ) = 1.
	cos θ = 4/5
	sin 30° = 1/2
	45 degrees = π/4 radians
	Amplitude = 3
	x = π/6 or x = 5π/6
	Period = π
	The Law of Sines is used to find missing sides or angles in any triangle, not just right triangles.
	The Law of Cosines states that c^2 = a^2 + b^2 - 2ab * cos(C), where c is the side opposite angle C.
	Area ≈ 10.93 square units
	The double angle formula for sin(2θ) is 2sin(θ)cos(θ).
	x = π/4 or x = 3π/4
	tan(π/4) = 1
	The graph of y = sin(x) is a wave that oscillates between -1 and 1, with a period of 2π.
